# The build.sh script builds stack images for the gcp/base builder.
#
# The script builds the following two images:
#   gcr.io/buildpacks/gcp/run
#   gcr.io/buildpacks/gcp/build
#
# It also validates that the build image includes all required licenses.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh <path to self> <path to licenses.tar>
